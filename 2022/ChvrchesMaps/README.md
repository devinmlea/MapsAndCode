### Chvrches Maps

In July 2022 I made a trio of maps to show the places and number of shows the band Chvrches played over their first decade. The color scheme for each map is based on the cover art of a different album released by Chvrches. The North America Map uses same color schema as 'The Bones of What You Believe'. The Pacific Map uses color and design scheme of 'Love Is Dead'. The Europe Map uses color schema basis from 'Screen Violence'.
