Project Goal
###########################################################

The inspiration for this map was spurred from a tweet by band member Lauren Mayberry
on 7/6/2022 noting that a decade prior on July 5, 2012 had been the first proper
Chvrches show in Glasgow. I was curious to see that now we've had Chvrches playing
shows for a decade where Chvrches have played since their beginning.

After looking at the archive of where Chvrches has played over time using
concertarchives.org, I decided to focus just on their shows in North America rather
than a global focus because I was afraid it would be too difficult to see places that
have only been played once or twice at the global scale, as well as that some places
like the US and UK would have just a bunch of overlapping circles at that scale and it
would be too hard to determine locations.

For design purposes, I wanted to capture what felt like a Chvrches classic aesthetic,
so I decided the color scheme for the map should be based on colors from their first
album, The Bones of What You Believe.

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Chvrches concert data (created .csv file)
2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile (shapefile)

1) Chvrches concert data

I went to the link below:
https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/chvrches
and from oldest to present went through all Chvrches recorded concerts. On
a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel I recorded data in five columns. From
left to right, those columns (+ description) were:
A) Band (band name; this was always "Chvrches")
B) Date (the date of the concert)
C) Venue (venue name)
D) OrigLocation (The original city name, state/province name, country name from the website)
E) UpLocation (updated city name, state/province name, country name)

The reason for the difference between the original location versus updated location was that
for display purposes I changed/aggregated the names of certain locations so to make a less
cluttered map. For example, I aggregated a number of cities in the Los Angeles metropolitan
area all into "Los Angeles" to simplify the display and understanding of the map, as it would
be too cluttered trying to display and label each individual city in the LA Metro area at the
North American continental scale.

All modifications I made from original listed location --> updated location:
San Francisco, CA, USA  -->  Bay Area, CA, USA
Oakland, CA, USA  -->  Bay Area, CA, USA
Napa, CA, USA  -->  Bay Area, CA, USA
Glen Ellen, CA, USA  -->  Bay Area, CA, USA

Hollywood, CA, USA  -->  Los Angeles, CA, USA
Santa Ana, CA, USA  -->  Los Angeles, CA, USA
Long Beach, CA, USA  -->  Los Angeles, CA, USA

Spokane, WA, USA  -->  George, WA, USA (the 5/27/13 concert was in George, not Spokane)


2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove Carribean islands so I would be able to have clear space for labels
for Miami and Ft. Lauderdale and other text I eventually would place in this area.


3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale lakes shapefile of Earth lakes from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-lakes-reservoirs/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove most of the lakes. I selected the lakes (below) to keep, then
inverted the selection and deleted all the other lakes.
Lakes to keep:
Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Great Salt Lake


###########################################################
Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the land polygons, lakes polygons, and concert
locations csv as points.

Given the extent of my data (USA, Mexico, Canada), I wanted a projected coordinate
system and decided on using North America Lambert Conformal Conic (ESRI: 102009),
so I switched to this projection using Project Properties.

Next, I wanted to display the concert locations as graduated symbols, where size is
based on the number of concerts. To do this, for the points layer under Properties ->
Symbology, I changed the type from "Single Symbol" to "Graduated". Then for Value
I selected the 'Concerts' attribute. Next, for Method I changed from "Color" to
"Size". I also changed 'Size from' parameters to 1.5 (min) to 10 (max), with units
in millimeters. The mode for class breaks I first set using Natural Breaks, but
manually made some changes. I ended up using 8 classes for a balance between
being continous and each unit adding size but also being able to see different
sizes between data. The concert values for each class are:
1-1
2-3
4-6
7-9
10-11
12-18
19-22
23-25

I then set colors for each layer. I wanted to use colors from the album cover of
The Bones of What You Believe, so I downloaded an example image and color sampled
the red, blue, and gray/beige using Paint software. I also used a black color from
QGIS. The R,G,B numbers are below for each display color
Red: R: 191, G: 36, B: 50;
Blue: R: 36, G: 119, B: 213
Black: R: 5, G: 5, B: 5
Beige: R: 203, G: 198, B: 168

I set land as Black, location points as Blue, and lakes as red. The background
once I go to Adobe Illustrator I will also set the same red color. The beige will be
used for text and labels in Adobe Illustrator.

I then exported the land and lakes as a PDF using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF
PDF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: 1:32,500,000
W bound: -2624224
N bound: 1654334
E bound: 2569546
S bound: -2464567
output tiff: 1571 x 1246 pixels

I also exported the graduated points as a PDF using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF
TIFF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: 1:32,500,000
W bound: -2624224
N bound: 1654334
E bound: 2569546
S bound: -2464567
output tiff: 1570 x 1245 pixels


I then brought PDFs into new Adobe Illustrator file and copied them to a new art board
with 1571 x 1246 pixels dimensions.

Adjusted size of the land + lakes layer and point locations layer by 292% so that
scaled them to the art board.

I ended up at the end of the map with six layers, which from top to bottom were:
- Title + Legend
- Text + Callouts
- Point Locations
- Masks
- Land + Lakes
- Background

Added new layer (Background) and created a rectangle to cover the whole artboard.
I then made this rectangle fill color matching the red noted above. I was using CMYK
color so the conversion color settings for the red color were:
C: 0
M: 81
Y: 74
K: 25

I also made the Masks layer and added smaller rectangles to cover up islands away
from North American landmass that were distracting

Adjusted positionality of points in the Points Location layer so that biggest circles
were lower position in the layer so that smaller circles that might overlap would
show above the larger circles

I then changed fill color for all circle outlines to white, and I changed the opacity of all
circles from 100 to 90%

The website below suggests the fonts that are used on the album cover of The Bones of What
You Believe:
https://fontmeme.com/the-bones-of-what-you-believe-font/
It suggests that Baskerville-Italic is the font used for the album title, but this font
was not available on my computer.
I acquired Baskerville-Italic font from this website:
https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Baskerville-Italic
I unzipped and copied the font file onto computer path: C:\Windows\Fonts
Then when re-opening Adobe Illustrator I could access and use the font.

The font color I wanted to be the same as the text on The Bones of What You Believe
cover. Converted beige values from RGB to CMYK were:
C: 0
M: 2
Y: 17
K: 20

I added the Text layer and used Baskerville-Italic font for all place naming and all
text except for Chvrches band name as part of title. Font size for location lables
was 16, all text on multiple lines were changed to have 18 leading value. I also added
callouts (lines connecting name and point) where necessary. These "lines" were rectangles
added with the rectangle tool. Some of the labels I put in bottom right corner with full
description because I could not fit them on the map; I used reference letters (A, B, C...)
on the map to help guide the viewer to the matching label.

The fontsgeek website notes that the title font was likely based on Journal Sans.
So I downloaded Journal Sans font from following website:
https://fontsov.com/download-fonts/journalsans10852.html
I unzipped and copied the font file onto computer path: C:\Windows\Fonts
Then when re-opening Adobe Illustrator I could access and use the font.
I added the Title layer and used this font for the band name as part of my title.
The title color was the same beige as other text. To try and replicate the signature
E in Chvrches band name I used red and beige rectangles to emphasize or get rid of
parts of the E. I also added a separate point as a legend to note that the circles
denote Place, state/country, and number of shows.

Adjustments I made to individual points to aid viewing:
Squamish, Canada - 1 bump up (north) to better differentiate from Vancouver
Orlando, FL - 1 bump right (east) to get closer to Atlantic Ocean and label
Ft. Lauderdale, FL - 2 bumps up (north) to differntiate from Miami
Sacramento, CA - 3 bumps right (east) to differ from Bay Area
Boulder, CO - 2 bumps down (south) to show diff from Denver
Providence, RI - 3 bumps down (south) to differ from Boston
Baltimore, MD - 1 bump left (west) and 2 up (north) to differ from DC metro
Durham, NC - 3 bumps left (west) to differ from Raleigh
Pittsburgh, PA - 3 bumps down (south) to give space for label name
Charlotte, NC - 3 bumps left (west) to give space for label name

Once all this was completed, I exported the map as a .JPEG and .PDF to be able
to show my product.

Notes/Limitations:
- The map depicts number of shows (so, if Chvrches plays 2x for Coachella, thats 2x in Palm Springs)
- This list goes by website I consulted. It doesn't necessarily list all performances that might
have been private/smaller sessions. I consulted other websites for past tour lists, deleted where
I thought duplicates existed and could verify using other concert lists.
