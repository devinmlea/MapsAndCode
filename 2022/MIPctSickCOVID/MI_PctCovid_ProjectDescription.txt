This document is broken into the following sections:

Software used for this project:
- Microsoft Excel

NOTE:
The R code I generated to perfom the data modification and visualization and which I
have made available on my website has been generalized so that if you would like to
replicate this project, you may follow the steps in this project description to
acquire the data and then visualize it using the accompanying R script, which I
am happy to share upon request.

Project Goal
###########################################################

The goal of this project was to create a visualization of temporal data, so I decided to
visualize the approximate percentage of people sick with COVID-19 over time in the state
of Michigan per Michigan county.

The full data available the day I began this project spanned the period of 03/14/2020
until 06/15/2022, with the individual time step being everyday. The COVID daily data
are still being updated, and daily data is usually available up to two days or so
before the present date.

Displaying the full amount of data would have created a large GIF, so I decided for
display purposes to select only a six month window of this time for the GIF shown on
my website.

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project with a custom date range, you can follow the
data acquisition + prep steps and then the data visualization steps in this file. If
you contact me by email, I would be happy to share the accompanying R script to
produce your visualization

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired and any quick preparations that were made to the data
before the data were modified and visualized in R (see Data Modification and Visualization section
for more information).

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Daily COVID cases per Michigan county data (.xlsx)
2) United States counties (shapefile)
3) MI county population data (created .csv file)


1) Daily COVID cases per Michigan county data

I acquired the daily COVID cases data per Michigan county from the Michigan.gov website here:
https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/stats

On this website there are several public use datasets that are being maintained and are
downloadable as .xlsx files. I downloaded from the link named "Cases and Deaths by County
by Date of Onset of Symptoms and Date of Death", which gives you a file with a similar
name as well as last date of update (in my case, 2022-06-15).

The downloaded .xlsx file has two tabs. There are eight columns on the first tab which
contains the data (COUNTY, Date, CASE_STATUS, Cases, Deaths, Cases.Cumulative,
Deaths.Cumulative, Updated). The second tab is a readme how data is collected and classified.

Since I was only interested in the first four columns for my project, I copied all rows
for the first four columns in the data tab to a new Microsoft Excel document. I then saved this
data with a new name and as a .csv file: "MIDailyCOVIDCases.csv"


2) United States counties shapefile

To show Michigan counties, I first obtained the 2018 cartographic boundary shapefile from US Census
Bureau of US Counties (cb_2018_us_county_500k). After unzipping, I opened the shapefile in ArcPro.
I used selected by attribute to select only Michigan counties and exported these to a new shapefile
I named "MI_Counties".

The Daily COVID cases per Michigan county data contained daily data for incarcerated people in
Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) and Federal Correction Institutions (FCI). I decided to
depict these populations along with the county populations. To do this, I added two polygons using
ArcPro in the area of Lake Superior and provided appropriate name attributes (MDOC and FCI) for these
two new polygons in the "MI_Counties" attribute table.

NOTE: I also manually changed "St. Clair" and "St. Joseph" to "St Clair" and St Joseph" in
the shapefile attribute table so the names would match the county names from the daily COVID data


3) MI county population data

I obtained MI county populations from link: https://www.michigan-demographics.com/counties_by_population
These population numbers were from 2020 American Community Survey. I copied them to a new Microsoft Excel
file and saved the file as a .csv named "MICountyPop.csv". 

The county names when I copied them were originally like "Alcona County", but I just wanted
the county name without the "County" part, so I then created an equation like below in a new column:
=LEFT(A2,FIND(" ",A2)-1)
Where A2 was "Alcona County" or equivalent cell. I used this to just get the county name, which I
then copied and saved values of over the original names and then deleted the equations.

NOTE: I also manually changed "St. Clair" and "St. Joseph" to "St Clair" and St Joseph" in the
county name  column of the .csv file so the names would match the county names from the daily COVID data

Finally, I added population values for FCI and MDOC to the csv file in Excel.

For FCI (Federal Correction Institution(s)), I determined there is only one FCI in Michigan, which
the website below says houses 1,313 inmates. I use this number for population.
https://prisonerresource.com/federal-bureau-prisons/michigan/

For MDOC (Michigan Department of Corrections), the website below notes that at the end of 2019
there were 38,053 people in MDOC facilities, while in January 2021 the number was 33,635, as no
census was taken between this time. I decided to take the average of these two numbers (35,844)
as my population for MDOC.

Data Modification and Visualization
###########################################################

Once the data were acquired and prepared, I wrote and ran an .R script named "MICovidDataVis.R"
that brought these data into its workspace, modified the data into the form I wanted, and then
combined daily data into a GIF visualization.

See MICovidDataVis.R for details of steps for data modification and visualization performed.
In summary, here are the primary steps that the script performs:
1) Read in MIDailyCOVIDCases.csv data
2) Aggregate confirmed and probable cases by County + Date
3) Calculate the rolling sum of COVID-19 over the past 14 days, set NA if prior 14 days not available
4) Remove NAs from data frame
5) Remove where COUNTY column = "Out-of-State" or "Unknown"
6) Create new data frame and combine rolling sum for Wayne County and Detroit
7) Delete old data where COUNTY column = "Detroit City" or "Wayne" and append new combined rolling
sum for Wayne County
8) Read in population data for MI counties, merge with Number of Sick dataframe, then calculate
Percent of Sick people
9) Read in MI_Counties polygon layer
10) Select date range for visualization
11) Join Pct Sick data to county polygons, define data breaks, then create GIF animation

For more information about the parameters you will need to set when using the R script, see
the "MICovidDataVis.R" file where I have provided more documentation

Important Notes
###########################################################

To determine what I call the "approximate number of people presently positive with COVID-19",
I assume that a person is positive for 2 weeks (14 days) after they have a confirmed or probable
case listed. I realize this is not likely accurate (people could have been positive for days
before testing, some people are positive/sick for longer than this time, and this metric doesn't
try to account for mortality from COVID-19 or issues of long covid), but I for simplicity wanted
a simple metric to just try to generally visualize the relative percentage of people sick per
each Michigan county.
