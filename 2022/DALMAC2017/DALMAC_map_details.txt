Project Goal
###########################################################

The goal was just to map something different and that I found interesting after
recently finishing my dissertation. I ended up coming across the DALMAC route
data and coming up with this idea based on that the 2017 route data were
openly available from ridewithgps.com

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:

1) GMTED2010N30W090 from USGS Earth Explorer (TIF)
2) Route data .kml files (.kml)
3) Route data elevation profiles (.csv file I created)


1) GMTED2010N30W090 from USGS Earth Explorer (TIF)

I decided that the background of the map I wanted to use topographic data
and have a shaded relief and hypsometric tint. So, I created a USGS account
so that I could download data from USGS Earth Explorer. On Earth Explorer I
decided to choose the GMTED2010 product, specifically using GMTED2010N30W090
which included Michigan and surrounding area of interest. I downloaded the
7.5 arcsecond product.

I then loaded the full 7.5 arcsecond product into QGIS and used the QGIS
tool "Clip Raster by Extent" to clip the raster down using the following bounds:
-87.5,-81.7,39.9,47.4 [EPSG:4326]
The resulting raster was saved as 'Michigan_clip'
* I learned how to do this using this link:
http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/working_with_terrain.html

After the clip, there was a patch up in Lake Superior with 0 values compared to
elevations around it. I decided to make this 'null patch' same values as surrounding
values in the lake (179), so I used "Raster Calculator" tool (under raster analysis tools)
to change all 0 values to 179. The expression I used to do this was:
("Michigan_clip@1" = 0) * ("Michigan_clip@1" + 179) + ("Michigan_clip@1" != 0) * "Michigan_clip@1"
The new raster output name was 'Michigan_clip_update'
* I based my expression based on description at the link below:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/385763/qgis-raster-calculator-if-statement/385899#385899

I then used the 'Michigan_clip_update' layer to make a hypsometric tint. To do this, I went to
Properties > Symbology, then changed render type to singleband pseudocolor. I then on the color
ramp selection I selected Create New Color Ramp. The colors for the custom color ramp are listed
below from left to right on ramp (4 total colors; so there are 2 breaks added)

Color one (Dark green)
H: 126
S: 96%
V: 44%
R: 5
G: 111
B: 15

Color two (mid green)
relative position: 25.0%
H: 106
S: 69%
V: 75%
R: 90
G: 190
B: 60

Color three (light green)
relative position: 60.0%
H: 95
S: 82%
V: 92%
R: 119
G: 234
B: 42

Color four (tan)
H: 62
S: 54
V: 94
R: 235
G: 239
B: 110

I then exported the hypsometric tint as a TIFF file using
Project > Import/Export > Export Map to Image

Hypsometric tint TIFF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: see note below
W bound: -88.241407904
N bound:47.132914831
E bound:-80.801552800
S bound:39.589368367
output tiff: 1492 x 1513 pixels
* Note on scale: somehow my scale got erased from this document so I don't have the exact
number I used. It was about 1:2600000 ballpark I think. I would go back and just re-do, but
I don't want to have to change scale for route data and then have to re-export and take several
days re-editing the routes so they don't overlap.

I then used the 'Michigan_clip_update' layer to create a hillshade layer. To do so, I used 
Hillshade tool as part of GDAL tools. I used following input parameters:
Z factor: 1
Sacel:1
Azimuth: 315
Altitude: 75
The output layer was saved with name 'Michigan_clip_update_hillshade75'

I then exported the hillshade as a TIFF file using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to Image
Hillsahde TIFF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: see note below
W bound: -88.241407904
N bound:47.132914831
E bound:-80.801552800
S bound:39.589368367
output tiff: 1485 x 1503 pixels
* Note on scale: somehow my scale got erased from this document so I don't have the exact
number I used. It was about 1:2600000 ballpark I think. I would go back and just re-do, but
I don't want to have to change scale for route data and then have to re-export and take several
days re-editing the routes so they don't overlap.

2) Route data .kml files (.kml)

I was able to obtain 2017 route data from the website link below:
https://ridewithgps.com/organizations/108-tri-county-bicycle-association/routes?

This site had all the major routes from 2017 and some other years that the Tri-county
bike association has uploaded on the site (originally was going to do 2021 since it
was 50th year, but that data is locked so I used 2017 since route data is open to
download). All the daily route data I was able to download as .kml files, which
I could read into and display in QGIS.

I decided to show four of the main DALMAC routes on my map: 5-day west, 4-day west,
4-day west century, and 5-day east. For each of these, I downloaded each relevant
daily route .kml files and brought them into QGIS. For each route, I displayed
all the .kml files and used Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF and saved
each set of routes as a PDF. I used the same export parameters as listed above for the
hypsometric tint and hillshade layers


3) Route data elevation profiles (.csv file I created)

Each route on the ridewithgps site also had an elevation profile and elevation gain
and loss. It took several days, but I ended up manually copying elevations at each
point along the elevation profiles for each route to construct a full elevation profile
for each day + route (in future, could also try to extract elevation profile from DEM).
However, the intervals of recording were not evenly spaced (at minimum they were at 0.1
mile intervals, but there was not an elevation at every 0.1 mile, so some days had more
data points than others, even if they were shorter distance). When I used excel area
graph, it assumed equal spacing of intervals. So, I wanted to interpolate between points
to get data with every 0.1 mile, so I wrote and ran a python script called
'Create_interpolated_elevations.py' that interpolated elevations between locations more
than every 0.1 mi apart using the route data in csvs for each of the four routes. This
code didn't do everything perfectly, so I had to make some manual changes to finalize
the elevations for each of the routes.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

Having both hillshade and hypsometric tint TIFF layers, I opened both in Adobe Photoshop
and also created a new file with dimensions 1492 (w) x 1513 (h) pixels. I then did following steps:
1) changed opacity of hypsometric tint to 50%
2) changed blending of hillshade layer using 'difference' blending
3) changed blending of hypsometric tint using 'color burn' blending
4) Increased vibrance + 100

I then saved the combined tint + hillshade as a new TIFF named 'Michigan_tint_hillshade_combined'


I then used Adobe Illustrator. First, I created a new document and brought in the
'Michigan_tint_hillshade_combined' TIFF layer. I saved this as an .ai file named
'Michigan_2017_DALMAC_final_map'. I then opened each route PDF and copied in each route
to the .ai file. 

Because the routes had overlap in places, I then took a few days to manually edit
vertices for the lines so they no longer overlapped each other or features of interests

Once I completed editing the routes, I added name labels for all the start and stop locations
for each route, as well as color coded symbols for each of the stops.

I then created area graphs for elevation in Microsoft Excel for each of the elevation profile
csvs. Below I list the dimensions of the graphs I copied from Excel and their altered and
scaled dimensions in Adobe Illustrator.

4WC (404.6 mi)
In Excel: H: 1.78, W: 5.32
White Box (original in AI): H: 128.16, W: 383.04
area graph (original): H: 106.8008, W: 361.799
Graph (altered): H: 15, W: 311.3387

5W (319.8 mi; 0.7904 ratio to 4WC)
W: 4.20 in Excel
expanded graph W: (311.3387 * 0.7904) = 246.082

4W (318.2 mi; 0.7864 ratio to 4WC)
W: 4.18 in Excel
expanded graph W: (311.3387 * 0.7864) = 244.8367

5E (283.7 mi; 0.7011 ratio to 4WC)
3.73 in Excel
expanded graph W: (311.3387 * 0.7011) = 218.279

Once the graphs were set in place, I changed the opacity to 75% for graphs. I then added
location and distance labels and markers. I also added a gray partially transparent background
behind the graphs to help it stand out from the main map area.

I then added title for the map as well as another gray partially transparent background

I then added elements for the legend. For the topography, I ended up taking screen shots of the
color ramp for the hypometric tint and hillshade in QGIS, then brining those jpgs into Adobe
Photoshop and applying the same blending and editing steps I did for the combined hypsometric
tint and hillshade layer. I then saved this as topo_legend.tif and then opened and copied
to my Adobe Illustrator file.

Finally, I added relevant text to label and describe the map
