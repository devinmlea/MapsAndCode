Project Goal
###########################################################

This was a just for fun map I created on "Star Wars Day" 2022 to show all places on Earth
that have been used for Star Wars worlds in all the various Star Wars movies. The map
only includes outdoor places used for the outdoor world scenes of the movies, and does
not include any sets or studios where parts of movies may also have been filmed.

If you would like to replicate this map, please follow the steps described in
the sections below

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Star Wars movie locations (created .csv file)
2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)
3) Image of star field for background

1) Star Wars movie locations

Obtained movie locations from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_filming_locations
and recorded data in six colums in Microsoft Excel or equivalent spreadsheet
program, which from left to right were:
A) Location (on Earth; e.g., London)
B) Country (e.g., United Kingdom)
C) Latitude of location
D) Longitude of location
E) Movie(s)
F) Star wars setting (e.g., Yavin 4)

Specifically to get Latitude and Longitude values for the spreadsheet I used
Google geocoding API.
Saved data in .csv file named: 'StarWarsFilmLocations.csv'


2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)

Downloaded 1:50 million scale land polygons from Natural Earth Data
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/


3) Star field image

I wanted a star field background for the map, so I used the following image I downloaded via Wikimedia:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2021-02-13_-_Sterne_von_Klein_Flintbek_aus_(3).jpg

Data Visualization
###########################################################

Opened QGIS and loaded in land polygons and movie locations csv as points layer

Changed map projection to Robinson Projection (ESRI: 54030)

For colors of points, I tried to match original vintage colors from A New Hope credits

Changed colors for land polygons
Fill: #8daec4 (blue gray)
Stroke: #10d1ff (light blue)
Stroke width: 0.35 mm

https://brandpalettes.com/star-wars-logo-colors/
For yellow color: #FFE81F
I used this yellow color for the point locations

I deleted Antarctica and some islands in polar antarctic circle from land polygons to
make map cleaner

I then exported the land polygons and points as two separate PDF layers named:
StarWars_Land
StarWars_Points

I used the values 17700000 for N,E, and -17700000 for S,W as export parameters


I then opened new Adobe Illustrator (AI) file and the exported land and points pdfs in AI.
I copied pdfs as new layers into the AI file and then scaled them by 375 % to increase
their size to match the artboard.

I created a new Background layer and opened the downloaded star field image and copied
it to my AI file under the background layer behind my other map layers.

Then I added text. I wanted the title of the map to match star wars fonts, so I downloaded
the font type called Star Jedi from https://www.starwarsfont.com/. I then copied the TrueType
file type into my fonts folder on my computer so I could access it in AI. For details how to do
this, see link:
https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Fonts-to-Illustrator

The font I used for the places was Franklin Gothic Medium Cond, which according to link below is
a close match to font used in credits for Star Wars: A New Hope

Once I had all my labels, I exported the map to .JPEG and .PDF file types to display
