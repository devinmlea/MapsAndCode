Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my OpenStreetMap contribution for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to play around with colors in QGIS
and trying to use colors from images of the city to set color palette

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were five data sources I acquired:
1) Ghana OpenStreetMap shapefiles from GeoFabrik (shapefiles)
2) Ghana Subnational Administrative Boundaries (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 1:10m oceans shapefile (shapefile)


1) Ghana OpenStreetMap shapefiles from GeoFabrik (shapefiles)
Obtained package of shapefiles for Ghana from GeoFabrik website:
https://download.geofabrik.de/africa/ghana.html
Downloaded the 'ghana-latest-free.shp.zip' file on 11/7/22
Unzipped and loaded layers into QGIS


2) Ghana Subnational Administrative Boundaries (shapefile)
Obtained adminstrative boundaries shapefiles from HumData:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-gha
downloaded 'gha_admbnda_gss_20210308_SHP.zip' file
Unzipped and loaded layer into QGIS


3) Natural Earth 1:10m oceans shapefile (shapefile)
Downloaded layer from Natural Earth Data:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/
Downloaded Ocean Layer, Unzipped, loaded into QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I loaded the following layers from OpenStreetMap into QGIS:
'gis_osm_water_a_free_1"
"gis_osm_waterways_free_1"
"gis_osm_roads_free_1"
"gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1"

For "gis_osm_waterways_free_1" I used select by attributes to make the following selection:
"fclass" = 'river' OR "fclass" = 'stream'
I then used Export -> Save Selected Features As to save these features to a new layer I
called 'Ghana_rivers_streams.shp'

For "gis_osm_roads_free_1" I used select by attributes to make the following selection:
"fclass" = 'trunk'
"fclass" = 'motorway'
"fclass" = 'primary'
"fclass" = 'secondary'
"fclass" = 'tertiary'
For each of these selections I used Export -> Save Selected Features As to save these features
to the following new layers:
'Ghana_trunk_roads'
'Ghana_motorway_roads'
'Ghana_primary_roads'
'Ghana_secondary_roads'
'Ghana_tertiary_roads'

For "gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1" I used select by attributes to make the following selection:
"fclass" = 'park' OR "fclass" = 'forest'
I then used Export -> Save Selected Features As to save these features to a new layer I
called 'Ghana_parks_forests.shp'

I also then loaded the 'gha_admbnda_adm2_gss_20210308' layer. After playing around with colors
and looking at aerial photographs of Accra, I decided I wanted to have part of the region
that was more urban to have a more brown/red earthy color, while parts farther from city center
that were less urban would have a green color. For what I determined to be more urban, I selected
the following administrative units (by 'ADM2_PCODE'):
GH0701, GH0702, GH0703, GH0704, GH0708, GH0709, GH0710, GH0711, GH0712, GH0718,
GH0720, GH0721, GH0723, GH0725, GH0727, GH0728

I then used Export -> Save Selected Features As to save these features to a new layer I
called 'AccraUrban'

I then inverted the selected and again used Export -> Save Selected Features As to save these
features to a new layer I called 'AccraGreen'

I also loaded in the 1:10m Oceans Natural Earth Data layer

I arranged the layers in the following order in QGIS (turning off/removing those not listed):
'Ghana_trunk_roads'
'Ghana_motorway_roads'
'Ghana_primary_roads'
'Ghana_secondary_roads'
'Ghana_tertiary_roads'
'Ghana_parks_forests'
'Ghana_rivers_streams'
'gis_osm_water_a_free_1'
'gis_osm_roads_free_1'
'AccraUrban'
'AccraGreen'
'ne_10m_ocean'


For the 'Ghana_trunk_roads', 'Ghana_motorway_roads', 'Ghana_primary_roads', 'Ghana_secondary_roads', and
'Ghana_tertiary_roads' layer I set color to R:80,B:80,G:85. I set stroke sizes as following:
'Ghana_trunk_roads': 0.8
'Ghana_motorway_roads': 0.8
'Ghana_primary_roads': 0.6
'Ghana_secondary_roads': 0.4
'Ghana_tertiary_roads': 0.2

For 'gis_osm_roads_free_1' I wanted to match coloring of dirt roads that are still common even in the city,
so I acquired an image from Wikimedia at link here:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:University_Of_Ghana,_Accra,_Ghana_-_panoramio.jpg
I sampled the color of the road in this image and acquired the color:
(#b47d54), R:180,B:125,G:84
This color was set for 'gis_osm_roads_free_1', stroke size = 0.08

For 'gis_osm_water_a_free_1', 'Ghana_rivers_streams', and 'ne_10m_ocean' I set fill and stroke
color to: (#8bc6e3)

For 'Ghana_parks_forests', fill and stroke color set to: (#759472)

'AccraUrban' fill color: #877d54, opacity = 40%
'AccraGreen' fill color: #5c7d54, opacity = 40%

Then exported map to PDF using following parameters:
1:150000
dpi: 250
W: -0.373175949
N: 5.689458117
E: -0.051790682
S: 5.483618505


Opened PDF in Adobe Illustrator and copied data to a new .ai file, resizing appropriately
to new artboard.

Then used ellipse tool to make circle, then selected all data and created a clipping mask to clip
the map to the circle

Used star tool to create star, fill and stroke were black

Typed 'ACCRA' and 'GHANA', 120 PT, Source Serif Variable font, 500 distance between characters
I then created three rectangles using the rectangle tools, each one had fill color based on
ghana flag colors from this website:
https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/ghana

For the texts I then used Effect -> Warp -> Arc to create arc of 90 and -90 to warp the
text.
