Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my minimal map for #30DayMapChallenge

I wanted a very minimal style and decided on just using words
instead of any map layers, emulating a style of map by Tim Stallmann in
"A People's Atlas of Detroit"

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were two data sources I acquired:
1) Percent Students Below Poverty Data (spreadsheet)
2) 3) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)


1) Percent Students Below Poverty Data 

I acquired the data from this link from MI Dept. of Education:
https://www.michigan.gov/mde/services/school-performance-supports/educational-supports/tools-and-resources/us-census-data

I downloaded data from the "Michigan Census 2020" link, which provided percentage
of students below poverty line for all Michigan school districts. I simply
copied the data to a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel and sorted by percentage
of students below poverty. I decided to focus on districts greater than 20% poverty,
which came out to 103 districts.

2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization

First opened QGIS and loaded states boundary shapefile. I selected Michigan and saved
it as its own layer. Then I exported the layer as a PDF at 1:5,500,000 resolution.

I opened this PDF in Adobe Illustrator and copied the layer on to a new .ai file and
scaled it appropriately.

I then added text for each of the 103 school districts. I first placed them as close as
I could to their actual geographic locations and took a screenshot once they were all
placed, so that then I could use this as a guide as I tried in my actual arrangement
to put the name as close as I could to its actual location, though of course I had to
make some adjustments.

In my actual arrangement, I chose a standard distance between each line of text, though
I used spacing to my advantage and used multiple single spaces in places to fit the
text to the form of the Michigan shapefile. At the end, I simply hid the shapefile,
thus only showing the school districts text. I then added title and my info.
