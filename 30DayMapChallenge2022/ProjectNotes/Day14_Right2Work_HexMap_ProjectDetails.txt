Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my hexagons map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to see a visualization of relationship between
"Right-To-Work" places (or not) and their minimum wages

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.


I didn't use any GIS type of data for this map. I created my own hexmap of US
states, territories, and commonwealths because I didn't like how hexagons
were being warped by projections when using geospatial data.

However, the data I used for the map came from a couple sources. First, the
minimum wage data came from the US Department of Labor website at this link:
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/state
When I acquired them, the last update was October 1, 2022

The data on whether a state, territory, or commonwealth had or did not have
a "Right-To-Work" law at time of making the map was determined both from
Wikipedia data:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-work_law
as well as from:
https://www.nrtw.org/right-to-work-states/

In my hex template I start from I had font Franklin Gothic Medium Cond

I first had to decide how I wanted to color my data. I decided there would be four
possible categories and each hexagon would be assigned from one of these four:
1) Has "Right-To-Work" law and pays federal minimum wage
2) Has "Right-To-Work" law and pays above federal minimum wage
3) No "Right-To-Work" law and pays federal minimum wage
4) No "Right-To-Work" law and pays above federal minimum wage

Due to data structure I wanted a diverging color scheme and ideally with colors that
generally were colorblind friendly. I settled on using colors from the Spending Per
Student, by School District map at link here:
https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2016/07/18/three-tools-to-help-you-make-colorblind-friendly-graphics/

I sampled the colors to obtain R,G,B values:
Orange- R:219,G:67,B:37 (R2W,min)
LightOr- R:237,G:162,B:78 (R2W,+min)
LightB- R:92,G:195,B:175 (Non,min)
Blue- R:10,G:98,B:100 (non,+min)

I decided on the following pairing of colors to categories:
1) Has "Right-To-Work" law and pays federal minimum wage = Orange
2) Has "Right-To-Work" law and pays above federal minimum wage = LightOr
3) No "Right-To-Work" law and pays federal minimum wage = LightB
4) No "Right-To-Work" law and pays above federal minimum wage = Blue

I then assigned the colors to each hexagon based on its category:
AL - Orange
AK - Blue
AZ - LightOr
AR - LightOr
CA - Blue
CO - Blue
CT - Blue
DE - Blue
DC - Blue
FL - LightOr
GA - Orange
HI - Blue
ID - Orange
IL - Blue
IN - Orange
IA - Orange
KS - Orange
KY - Orange
LA - Orange
ME - Blue
MD - Blue
MA - Blue
MI - LightOr
MN - Blue
MS - Orange
MO - Blue
MT - Blue
NE - LightOr
NV - LightOr
NH - LightB
NJ - Blue
NM - Blue
NY - Blue
NC - Orange
ND - Orange
OH - Blue
OK - Orange
OR - Blue
PA - LightB
RI - Blue
SC - Orange
SD - LightOr
TN - Orange
TX - Orange
UT - Orange
VT - Blue
VA - LightOr
WA - Blue
WV - LightOr
WI - Orange
WY - Orange

I then added minimum wage for each hexagon and realigned text so it was in the
middle of the respective hexagon. I also changed font on orange and blue to
white text so it was easier to see.

Added remaining elements like key and relevant text
