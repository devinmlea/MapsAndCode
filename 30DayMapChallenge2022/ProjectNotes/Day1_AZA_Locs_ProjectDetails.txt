Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my lines map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to create this map to familiarize myself with AZA institutions
because of my wife's work for an AZA institution

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) AZA USA location data (created .csv file)
2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile (shapefile)
4) US Census Bureau 20m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)

1) AZA USA location data

I went to the AZA Current Accredited Zoos and Aquariums webpage:
https://www.aza.org/current-accreditation-list?locale=en

On this page I copied to a .csv file (named AZA_US_Locations.csv) all institutions
that were located in the United States. Specifically, I ended up with 5 columns
in my csv file: Name, City, State, Lat, and Long.
I used name to verify city and state of the institution on world wide web.
Lat and Long coordinates I acquired using Google geocoding API interface here:
https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geocoder

2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/

After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale lakes shapefile of Earth lakes from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-lakes-reservoirs/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove most of the lakes. I selected the lakes (below) to keep, then
inverted the selection and deleted all the other lakes.
Lakes to keep:
Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Great Salt Lake

4) US Census Bureau 20m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the land polygons, lakes polygons, states
polygons, and AZA locations csv as points.

Given the extent of my data (USA), I wanted a projected coordinate system to show
contiguous US part and decided on using North America Lambert Conformal Conic
(ESRI: 102009), so I switched to this projection using Project Properties.

I then set colors for each layer. I wanted to use colors from AZA logo and website,
so I downloaded an example image of AZA logo and color sampled the red, green, blue
using Paint software. The R,G,B numbers are below for each display color
Gray: R: 172, G: 161, B: 150
Orange: R: 244, G: 132, B: 102
White: R: 255, G: 255, B: 255
Black: R: 35, G: 35, B: 35

I set land and states as gray fill (states had white stroke of 0.26, land no stroke),
location points as orange (with black stroke), and lakes as black (no stroke). The background
once I go to Adobe Illustrator I will also be black. The orange will be
used for text in Adobe Illustrator.


I then exported the land and lakes as a PDF using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF
PDF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: 1:30,000,000
W bound: -4310127.4201
N bound: 1381335.1453
E bound: 2357372.5867
S bound: -3189039.8591
output tiff: 2188 x 1401 pixels


I then brought PDF into new Adobe Illustrator file and copied them to a new art board
with 2188 x 1401 pixels dimensions.

Adjusted size of the land + lakes layer and point locations layer by 275% so that
scaled them to the art board.


Created separate AK map in QGIS for export, then scaled by 150% in AI. I then copied a
point from the contiguous US map to cover single AK point location to make points same size

Created separate HI map in QGIS for export, then scaled by 200% in AI. I then copied a
point from the contiguous US map to cover single HI point location to make points same size


Made points 80% opacity, put 0.5 stroke for point outlines (same gray color
as background), also moved some points a bit in the urban areas with lots of
overlap to see some points better
