Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my scale map for #30DayMapChallenge

I didn't really have an idea going into this day what I was
going to do, so stumbled across supreme court stuff thinking
about "scales of justice" and developed the idea from there

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

I didn't use any GIS type of data for this map. I created my own hexmap of US
states because I didn't like how hexagons were being warped by projections
when using geospatial data.

However, the data I used for the map came from a couple sources. First, the
data about term limits and selection choice of justices for state supreme courts
came from this Wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court
The data about levels of state courts I found from searching "levels of state courts"
in Google and creating my own graphic on my map that fit results and articles
I found describing these levels.

Data Visualization

Originally I had font Franklin Gothic Medium Cond, switched to Myriad Pro because of
issue with creating halo around the state abbreviations, but in future iteration
will probably change back to Franklin Gothic Medium Cond because it was better visually

I first had to decide how I wanted to color the two types of data. For selection
of justices, I simplified to four possible categories and each hexagon would be
assigned from one of these four:
1) Appointment by governor and/or state legislature
2) Partisan Election
3) Non-Partisan Election
4) Missouri Plan

Similarly, for justice term limits, I grouped possibilities into three categories:
6-8 years
10-15 years
Life

I decided to go with a four color scheme for the selection process, while used
grayscale for the three term limit options, so that these could be distinctly
seen from each other, even though term limits would be a smaller hexagon inside
selection of justices.

I set colors for selection process and terms, then put white halo around text
(I would choose to not do this in future and just change text to either white
or black where better suited)

I then obtained and added the stock photo of the scales and added the boxes
and text showing progress of judicial scales

Then added other text and key
