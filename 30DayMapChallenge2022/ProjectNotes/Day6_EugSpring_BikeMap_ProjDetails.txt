Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my network map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also really liked the idea of visualizing the paths this way because
I find this kind of map visually appealing

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) OSM Extracts for Eugene (shapefile)
2) Bike image (pixabay)
3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
4) Eugene Location (.csv I created)


1) OSM Extracts for Eugene (shapefile)

Downloaded Open Street Map extracts from BBBike at link:
https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/Eugene/

Extracted data and loaded into QGIS


2) Bike image (pixabay)

Got a simple bicycle image download from pixabay at link:
https://pixabay.com/vectors/bike-bicycle-pictogram-symbol-160920/

Used this to create north arrow in Adobe Illustrator


3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


4) Eugene location (.csv)

I created a .csv file in Microsoft Excel with three columns: (1) name, (2) lat, (3) lon.
Name = Eugene. I obtained lat and lon coordinates for Eugene using Google geocoding API:
https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geocoder

The .csv was loaded in with state cartographic boundary file in QGIS to map Eugene location in Oregon

Data Visualization
###########################################################

Initially loaded Eugene shapefile data from OSM into QGIS and selected by attribute to
find all lines part of the roads layer where road type = cycleway.
I made these into a new layer. I then determined what were the main bike paths
in Eugene-Springfield area based on knowledge and names in the name column.

I then exported the Eugene-Springfield cycleways layer as a PDF using following
parameters:

1:90000
Resolution: 250dpi
N: 44.174611587
E: -122.864002117
S: 43.948718789
W: -123.216697193


Once in Adobe Illustrator, I used paths as general guides of where to place my paths,
although I moved and scaled some things different to give myself adequate space and
for aesthetics. For example, I created more space between Willamette and McKenzie rivers
to have more space for Springfield bike paths. I also took cartographic liberty to make
connections between some of the bike paths that come close to each other but don't have
direct connections to create appearance of connected system.

For coloring of bike paths, I wanted a selection of several colors but that would also
minimize any color blindness issues, so I decided to use the true color palette here:

After placing map elements and key, I decided I also wanted a north arrow. I searched
images on Pixabay and found a bicycle clip art that I could alter the frame color to
look like an N for a north arrow. Image here:
https://pixabay.com/vectors/bike-bicycle-pictogram-symbol-160920/
I made other parts of the bike gray while keeping part of the frame black using
Microsoft Paint software. Then I opened and copied the image into Adobe Illustrator.


When map was mostly set I decided I also wanted an oregon outline and star to show location
of Eugene-Springfield. To do this I acquired the US Census Bureau states carto boundary files
and I created the Eugene lat/long location .csv. I loaded these into a new session of QGIS.

I first selected Oregon from the states shapefile and saved it as its own new shapefile.

I then changed the projection to Oregon Lambert Projection (EPSG 2992)

I then made Oregon white fill with black 0.5 stroke. For the Eugene location, I changed the
symbol to a black star.

I then exported the Oregon and Eugene location map as a PDF with following parameters.

1:6533057
Resolution: 250dpi
N: 2454675.5155
E: 3856073.6304
S: -596352.9769
W: -907613.9784

I then loaded the PDF into Adobe Illustrator and copied all PDF elements into a new AI layer
and appropriately sized and placed the Oregon outline with the whole map.
