Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my polygon map for #30DayMapChallenge

I figured this was an easy and fun way to visualize all the places
I have traveled in the United States

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project and do something similar for yourself,
I have detailed the software I used and actions I performed in the sections below
that you can follow to re-create my product for your own travels.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired, initally layered in QGIS in following order:

1) US Counties List and my interaction with them (.csv I created)
2) US Census Bureau 5m counties Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
3) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
4) US Census Bureau 5m nation Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)


1) US Counties List and my interaction with them (.csv I created)

I first acquired a list of all United States counties and equivalents and their fips codes.
To do this, I went to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_FIPS_codes_by_county
and copied the table into a new Microsoft Excel document and saved it as a .csv file.
I edited the file to remove the state column, so at first there was only the FIPS column and
County name column. I then added third column I just called "Rank" which I assigned a 0, 1, 2,
or 3.
0 = Never been there
1 = Traveled through
2 = Stayed a night
3 = Lived There


2) US Census Bureau 5m Counties Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


4) US Census Bureau 5m Nation Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

After loading files into GIS, I performed following steps.

I joined the .csv to the counties layer based on FIPS codes. To do this, I first
added a column to the counties layer that was an intiger instead of text and set
this equal to FIPS column so that I could then join this new column (which I called
FIPS2) to the FIPS column from the .csv

For counties, I changed symbology to sort based on categories of the Rank column.
For each rank value I used following fill colors.
0- R:220, G:220, B:225
1- R:160, G:160, B:165
2- R:95, G:95, B:100
3- R:0, G:0, B:0
For all ranks I removed stroke so there were no outlines of counties

For states and national layers I made the fill transparent (0% opacity) and set a
1pt white stroke to lightly show outlines.

I then exported the map layers as a PDF using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF
PDF export parameters:
For contiguous US:
1:22,000,000
W: -2139878.2584
N: 870975.7088
E: 2749621.7466
S: -2260632.6278
2188 x 1401

For AK:
1:22,000,000
W: -5265665.7616
N: 4171388.2121
E: -376165.7566
S: 1039779.8756

For HI:
1:22,000,000
W: -7838474.0976
N: 1028138.2089
E: -2948974.0926
S: -2103470.1276



I then brought PDFs into new Adobe Illustrator file and copied them to a new art board
with 2200 x 1600 pixels dimensions.


Adjusted size of contiguous US layer by 275% so that scaled them to the art board.

Scaled AK by 80% in AI. Scaled HI by 150%.

Added text and rectangles with matching color fill to create a simple key below title
