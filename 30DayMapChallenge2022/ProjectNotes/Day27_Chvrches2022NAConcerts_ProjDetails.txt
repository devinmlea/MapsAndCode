Project Goal
###########################################################

The most immediate goal was to have this for my day 27 (music) of
30 Day Map Challenge 2022.

I already had compiled Chvrches concerts up to summer 2022, so I
just added to that list for remainder of this year up until
their last leg ended in October

For design purposes, I wanted emulate a style from one of their
tour posters. I ended up using one from earlier in the year with
the three primary colors red, teal, blue being those for the
three legs of the tour throughout the year.

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Chvrches concert data (created .csv file)
2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile (shapefile)

This past summer I had already gone to link here:
https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/chvrches
and went through all Chvrches recorded concerts up until early July 2022.
I went back through the website and added all concerts in North America
after I had left off until present, also consulting the Chvrches Twitter
page over the past year for reference of all posted concerts. Again, this
was all recorded in Microsoft Excel and I had in five columns. From
left to right, those columns (+ description) were:
A) Band (band name; this was always "Chvrches")
B) Date (the date of the concert)
C) Venue (venue name)
D) OrigLocation (The original city name, state/province name, country name from the website)
E) UpLocation (updated city name, state/province name, country name)

Once I had updated the Excel sheet I selected out all the 2022 data
and saved to a new spredsheet that would be used to make my map

To this data I added another column that was a value of venue maximum capacity
I searched on Google each venue name and its maximum capacity and saved this
name in the appropriate row

2) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove Carribean islands so I would be able to have clear space for labels
for Miami and Ft. Lauderdale and other text I eventually would place in this area.


3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale lakes shapefile of Earth lakes from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-lakes-reservoirs/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove most of the lakes. I selected the lakes (below) to keep, then
inverted the selection and deleted all the other lakes.
Lakes to keep:
Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Great Salt Lake

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the land polygons, lakes polygons, and 2022 concert
locations csv as points.

I ended up doing essentially all my work in Adobe Illustrator, as I first just exported
the points, lakes, and land polygon at 1:28,000,000 scale to a PDF, and opened the PDF
and copied the data to a new .ai file.

I first set colors of the layers after also adding a rectangle as a background
behind the data
Rectangle: Fill color = R:20,G:20,B:20
Land: Fill color =  R:0,G:0,B:0; Stroke = R:255,G:255,B:255, width = 0.2
Lakes: Fill color = R:20,G:20,B:20
Leg 1 points color = R:0,G:165,B:130 (teal)
Leg 2 points color = R:190,G:40,B:46 (red)
Leg 3 points color = R:8,G:182,B:224 (blue)

The colors for the legs of the tour were sampled using eyedropper in Microsoft
Paint from a fall 2022 concerts announcement poster of the tour

I then set size of each location based on maximum venue capacity as follows:
Max Capacity - circle size (pixels)
> 100,000 - 30,30
10,000-100k - 20,20
1,000-10,000 - 10,10
< 1,000 - 6,6

Circles were set to opacity 80%

I then added the flow arrows using the curvature tool and adding arrow heads
under the stroke options, and setting the arrows same color as corresponsing
points

I then added the text and callouts (if necessary) for concert locations

Finally, I added the remaining key, title, and info text. I generally kept
these white, although for title I tried to emulate the Chvrches logo on the
tour posters. To do this I added black lines horizontal accros the title,
but I gave them low opacity (between 20-50%) and also gave them inner glow,
which overall produced the static TV kind of look
