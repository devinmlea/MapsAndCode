Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my raster map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn a bit of using
rayshader and related packages in R


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

The main source I used to help guide me in working through my rayshader exploration was:

1) Spencer Schien's "Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

Thanks to Spencer for creating a nice resource to help introduce to this R package

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) National Forest Polygons (shapefile)
2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
3) raster data from elevatr R package


1) National Forest polygons

From the USDA Forest Service website I downloaded national dataset of National Forest polygons,
with the file named "Administrative Forest Boundaries" from:
https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries

I downloaded this shapefile then imported it into QGIS


2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


3) Raster data from elevatr R package
This data was called and used as part of get_elev_raster() and the elevatr R package.
See the R code below and Spencer Schien's blog post for more information on this data.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I initially loaded the USDA National Forest Layer into QGIS. In QGIS I selected the Willamette
Forest Polygon and saved it as a new shapefile layer.

I then started working in R following Spencer Schien's
"Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

I suggest you also follow Spencer's guide, which explains more than I do below
why each step was taken.

I ended up playing around with a lot of variables to see what looks good, which I encourage
you to also do whether you are trying to replicate my map or create your own. But below is
the R code that generated the raster I used for my map. I needed to add a lot of new packages
to get some things to run, so ignore those if you already have installed and loaded.

Start of Rstats code:

install.packages("elevatr")
install.packages("rgdal")
install.packages("progress")
install.packages("rayshader")
install.packages("MetBrewer")
install.packages("magick")
install.packages("rayrender")

# read in boundary polygon
willforpoly <- st_read("FilePath/WillametteNF.shp")

# Query for elevation data, masked by our 'location' specified as the willforpoly
wf_elev <- get_elev_raster(willforpoly, z = 10, clip = "location")

# Convert raster to matrix 
wf_mat <- raster_to_matrix(wf_elev)

# choose Cassatt2 palette from MetBrewer
pal <- "VanGogh3"
palcolors <- met.brewer(pal)

# Dynaimcally set window height and width based on object size
w <- nrow(wr_mat)
h <- ncol(wr_mat)

# Scale the dimensions so we can use them as multipliers
wr <- w / max(c(w,h))
hr <- h / max(c(w,h))

# Limit ratio so that the shorter side is at least .75 of longer side
if (min(c(wr, hr)) < .75) {
  if (wr < .75) {
    wr <- .75
  } else {
    hr <- .75
  }
}

wr_mat %>%
  height_shade(texture = grDevices::colorRampPalette(palcolors)(256)) %>%
  plot_3d(heightmap = wr_mat, 
          windowsize = c(800*wr,800*hr), 
          solid = FALSE, 
          zscale = 10,
          phi = 90, 
          zoom = .6, 
          theta = 0)

render_snapshot()

rgl::rgl.close()

end Rstats code
############################################################

After using render_snapshot(), I exported the figure as a PDF.

I then opened the PDF in Adobe Illustrator and copied the data to a new .ai file
and sized it appropriately to the artboard using scale.

I added my text, north arrow, and legend. Font type was Script MT Bold. The fill and stroke
color for the text, north arrow, and legend were sampled from the raster image using the eyedropper
tool. The fill color was from low elevation while stroke from high elevation. The hex codes were:
C8D8AB (low elevation)
29662D (high elevation)

To create the north arrow I used the N text and created a line using the line segment tool, which
I then edited under stroke properties to add the arrow point and arrow fletching. I added the
squares for the low and high elevations using the rectangle tool.

Finally, I wanted to show where Willamette National Forest is within Oregon, so in a new QGIS
project I loaded the Census Bureau 5m shapefile and selected Oregon polygon and saved it as a
new shapefile layer. I then removed the US states polygon and changed the projection of the Oregon
polygon to Oregon Lambert Projection (EPSG 2992). I then added the Willamette Forest Polygon and
edited the layers to have colors matching the raster image. Specifically, I used stroke color
29662D for Oregon outline (and white fill). I used 29662D color also for Willamette NF outline,
while I used C8D8AB color for fill.

I then exported Oregon outline and Willamette National Forest fill as a PDF using following parameters
dpi:250
1:5000000
N: 2049572.2780
E: 3133066.4902
S: -285497.1664
W: -512766.8432

This PDF I then loaded into Adobe Illustrator, and I copied the data over to my .ai file with the raster
data and appropriately sized and placed it on the map
