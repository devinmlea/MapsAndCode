Project Goal
###########################################################

In exploring the Kontur dataset and how to visualize it, I saw
a few other maps using aerialod and decided I would try to
create something in that software and learn a bit of how
to use it

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were two data sources I acquired:
1) Kontur Data for the United States (geopackage)
2) Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Areas (shapefile)
3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile


1) Kontur Data for the United States 
Obtained Kontur Data for the United States here:
https://data.humdata.org/organization/kontur
Downloaded and unzipped to obtain geopackage file, then loaded in QGIS

2) Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Areas (shapefile)
Obtained the file from link:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
2021
Core Based Statistical Areas -> Metro/Micro Statistical Area
Downloaded, unzipped, loaded shapefile into QGIS

3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the three data layers

I selected the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn metro area using Select Features
and then saved the selection to a new layer using Export -> Save
Selected Features As

I again used Select Features to select the Michigan polygon from the
US States file and then saved the selection to a new layer using Export ->
Save Selected Features As

I then used clip to clip the Detroit Metropolitan Area file to the extent
of the Michigan Cartographic boundary layer

I then used Select By Location to select all of the hexagons in the Kontur
layer that intersected the clipped Detroit Metro layer, and again saved the
selection to a new layer using Export -> Save Selected Features As

Next I used the Vectorize (vector to raster) tool to convert the Detroit
metro Kontur hexagons into a raster. Width/horizontal resolution set to 400.

The resulting raster had raster cells with no data, so to deal with this I used
the GRASS tool r.null in QGIS. Within this tool my inputs:
List of cell values to be set to NULL = -99999
The value to replace the null value by = 0.0
Raster Output name = DetPopRasterNoNull
This replaced null values with 0s

Then used raster render

https://automaticknowledge.org/training/workbooks/5.%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Aerialod.pdf

Then downloaded and opened Aerialod and loaded the raster that had been rendered.
Then rotated around until I found the angle I liked. I tried to play with colors
and lighting, but generally used the defaults. Saved output image of this using
screen shot.

To create MI Inset Map
-Obtained outline of MI by selecting from 1:5m state boundaries file
and saving to a new layer, then using white fill and black (R:35,G:35,B:35)
0.5 stroke width (white fill set to same as background color later in AI)
-Obtained Detroit Metro Area by downloading from this website:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
2021 -> Core Based Statistical Areas -> Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Area
After downloading and unzipping file and loading into QGIS, I selected the
Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI MSA and saved the selected feature to a new shapefile layer
I then used the Clip tool to clip the Detroit MSA layer to extent of the Michigan
Boundary Layer. This clipped output of Detroit MSA was layered on top of the
Michigan boundary layer and was colored gray (R:128,G:128,B:128) and stroke
color was R:35,G:35,B:35 with width 0.2

I then loaded the screen shot image into Adobe Illustrator and copied the
image to a new .ai file. Then also loaded in, copied, and scaled the MI
inset map. Finally added text.
