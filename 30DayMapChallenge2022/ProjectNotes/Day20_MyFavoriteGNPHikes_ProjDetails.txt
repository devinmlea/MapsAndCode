Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my favorite topic map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn a bit of using
rayshader and related packages in R


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

The main source I used to help guide me in working through my rayshader exploration was:

1) Spencer Schien's "Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

Thanks to Spencer for creating a nice resource to help introduce to this R package

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) National Parks Land Boundary Layer (shapefile)


1) National Parks Land Boundary Layer (shapefile)
Acquired National Parks Boundaries from link:
https://public-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset&q=boundaries
Downloaded from link named "nps boundary"
Unzipped and loaded file into QGIS


###########################################################
Data Visualization
###########################################################

I initially loaded the National Parks Service layer into QGIS. In QGIS I selected the
Glacier National Park Polygon and saved it as a new shapefile layer.

I then digitized an approximate boundary area of the Many Glacier area I wanted to
focus on, to do this I used an elevation raster of the area

I then started working in R following Spencer Schien's
"Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

I suggest you also follow Spencer's guide, which explains more than I do below
why each step was taken.

I ended up playing around with a lot of variables to see what looks good, which I encourage
you to also do whether you are trying to replicate my map or create your own. But below is
the R code that generated the raster I used for my map. I needed to add a lot of new packages
to get some things to run, so ignore those if you already have installed and loaded.

Start of Rstats code:

library(sf)
library(elevatr)
library(rgdal)
library(progress)
library(rayshader)
library(MetBrewer)
library(magick)
library(rayrender)

# read in boundary polygon
#GNPpoly <- st_read("C:/Users/devin/Desktop/Personal_Resources/MapProjects/30DayMapChallenge_2022/Day20_Favorite/GlacierNP_Shp.shp")
GNPpoly <- st_read("C:/Users/devin/Desktop/Personal_Resources/MapProjects/30DayMapChallenge_2022/Day20_Favorite/ManyGlacierBnd.shp")

# Query for elevation data, masked by our 'location' specified as the windrivpoly
wr_elev <- get_elev_raster(GNPpoly, z = 13, clip = "location")

# Convert raster to matrix 
wr_mat <- raster_to_matrix(wr_elev)

# choose Cassatt2 palette from MetBrewer
#pal <- "Cassatt2"
pal <- "Hokusai2"
palcolors <- met.brewer(pal)

# Dynaimcally set window height and width based on object size
w <- nrow(wr_mat)
h <- ncol(wr_mat)

# Scale the dimensions so we can use them as multipliers
wr <- w / max(c(w,h))
hr <- h / max(c(w,h))

# Limit ratio so that the shorter side is at least .75 of longer side
if (min(c(wr, hr)) < .75) {
  if (wr < .75) {
    wr <- .75
  } else {
    hr <- .75
  }
}

wr_mat %>%
  sphere_shade(texture = "imhof2") %>%
  #height_shade(texture = grDevices::colorRampPalette(palcolors)(256)) %>%
  #add_water(detect_water(wr_mat), color = "imhof3") %>%
  plot_3d(heightmap = wr_mat, 
          windowsize = c(800*wr,800*hr), 
          solid = FALSE, 
          zscale = 2,
          phi = 90, 
          zoom = .6, 
          theta = 0)

)

render_snapshot()

rgl::rgl.close()

To produce my final angle of the 3D model, I also figured out you could manually
adjust the angle of view by clicking/holding/and moving my mouse while in the
window of the model that opens when calling wr_mat

After using render_snapshot(), I exported the figure as a PDF.

I then opened the PDF in Adobe Illustrator and copied the data to a new .ai file
and sized it appropriately to the artboard using scale.

I then used the rectangle tool and altered the rectangles to polygons by adjusting
individual points to create the lakes in the area based on maps I have of
the Many Glacier area

I then added appropriate lines, text, and pictures
