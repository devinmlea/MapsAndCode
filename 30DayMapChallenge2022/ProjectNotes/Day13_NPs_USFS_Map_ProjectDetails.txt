Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my 5 minute map for #30DayMapChallenge

I wanted a couple data layers for this purpose that I could just
display

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

If you count acquiring and doing a few prep things before actually taking the actions
of making the map, the map took longer. Below are the data prep steps I took before
actually the 5 minutes of making the map.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)
2) US Census Bureau national boundaries layer (shapefile)
3) National Forest Service Lands Boundary Layer (shapefile)
4) National Parks Land Boundary Layer (shapefile)

1) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/

After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


2) US Census Bureau 5m Nation Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


3) National Forest polygons

From the USDA Forest Service website I downloaded national dataset of National Forest polygons,
with the file named "Administrative Forest Boundaries" from:
https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries

I downloaded this shapefile then imported it into QGIS


4) National Parks Land Boundary Layer (shapefile)
Acquired National Parks Boundaries from link:
https://public-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset&q=boundaries
Downloaded from link named "nps boundary"
Unzipped and loaded file into QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I did the following steps in about 5 minutes

With QGIS opened, I loaded in the four layers and arranged in order:
-National Parks Lands
-National Forest Lands
-National Boundaries Layer
-Natural Earth 50m layer

Given the extent of my data (USA), I changed projection to EPSG 2163,
US National Atlas Equal Area

I then in symbology changed each layer as following:
Forest service layer: fill:R:0,G:80,B:47, stroke:0.2, same color
NP color: fill:R:197,G:108,B:57, stroke:0.2, same color
1:50m Land color : fill:white, stroke:0.1,R:220,G:220,B:220
National boundary layer colors: fill:white, stroke:0.1, black color

Then set scale to 1:55,000,000 and exported as jpg image

I then loaded the file in Adobe Illustrator and used rectangle tool
to make the key and eyedropper color to match colors to the map layers,
then used type tool to add text
