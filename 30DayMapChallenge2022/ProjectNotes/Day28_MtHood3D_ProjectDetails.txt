Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my 3D map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn a bit of using
rayshader 3D stuff and related packages in R


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

The main source I used to help guide me in working through my rayshader exploration was:

1) Spencer Schien's "Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

Thanks to Spencer for creating a nice resource to help introduce to this R package

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) National Forest Polygons (shapefile)
2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
3) raster data from elevatr R package


1) National Forest polygons

From the USDA Forest Service website I downloaded national dataset of National Forest polygons,
with the file named "Administrative Forest Boundaries" from:
https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries

I downloaded this shapefile then imported it into QGIS


2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


3) Raster data from elevatr R package
This data was called and used as part of get_elev_raster() and the elevatr R package.
See the R code below and Spencer Schien's blog post for more information on this data.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I initially loaded the USDA National Forest Layer into QGIS. In QGIS I selected the Mt. Hood
Forest Polygon and saved it as a new shapefile layer.

I then started working in R following Spencer Schien's
"Creating High-Quality 3D Visuals with Rayshader" blog post:
https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/

I suggest you also follow Spencer's guide, which generally explains more than I do below
why each step was taken.

I ended up playing around with a lot of variables to see what looks good, which I encourage
you to also do whether you are trying to replicate my map or create your own. But below is
the R code that generated the raster I used for my map. I needed to add a lot of new packages
to get some things to run, so ignore those if you already have installed and loaded.

end Rstats code

After using render_snapshot(), I exported the figure as a image called
'MtHoodPic'.

I then opened the image in Adobe Photoshopand used Select -> Select and Mask tools,
which allowed me to highlight the 3D Mt. Hood area and remove the white background.
Saved new image as 'MtHoodPic_Transparent'

I then opened the 'MtHoodPic_Transparent' in Adobe Illustrator and copied the data to
a new .ai file and sized it appropriately to the artboard using scale.

I wanted to try to make my map have a foggy feel to it like the Mt. Hood area can have,
especially in later fall, winter, spring, so I took several steps to do that:

I first used the rectangle tool to add a rectangle behind the 3D data. Its color was
R:204,G:204,B:204.

For the 'MtHoodPic_Transparent' image I added an Inner Glow effect:
mode: Normal with color R:204,G:204,B:204, opacity:35%, blur:144px, from edge

I then added text and callout. I sampled color from around top of Mt. Hood, so I
used color #1e5420 for my text. For the text and callouts I then used the
feather tool to add the effect around the edges of the text

Finally, I wanted to show where Mt. Hood National Forest is within Oregon, so in a new QGIS
project I loaded the Census Bureau 5m shapefile and selected Oregon polygon and saved it as a
new shapefile layer. I then removed the US states polygon and changed the projection of the Oregon
polygon to Oregon Lambert Projection (EPSG 2992). I then added the Mt. Hood Forest Polygon and
edited the layers to have colors matching the raster image. Specifically, I used stroke color
#1e5420 for Oregon outline (and white fill). I used #1e5420 color also for Mt. Hood NF outline,
while I used #B3CE97 color for fill.

I then exported Oregon outline and Mt. Hood National Forest fill as a PDF using following parameters
dpi:250
1:5000000

This PDF I then loaded into Adobe Illustrator, and I copied the data over to my .ai file with the raster
data and appropriately sized and placed it on the map
