Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my lines map for #30DayMapChallenge

I also wanted to make the map to better acquaint myself with the
history of line 5 and the fight to shut it down

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.


###########################################################
Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were seven data sources I acquired, initally layered in QGIS in following order:
1) Historical oil spills (.csv I created)
2) Crude Oil Pipelines data (shapefile)
3) National Forest Polygons (shapefile)
4) Line 5 spill scenarios (shapefile I created)
5) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
6) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile (shapefile)
7) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)


1) Historical oil spills (.csv I created)

This is a .csv layer I created based on data provided at this website:
https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=f817f5abad9a4cb09e942c1941fd0060
It is also based on the first map from this webpage showing spills :
https://www.sierraclub.org/wisconsin/line-5

I created a new shapefile in QGIS to generate this point layer. I named the layer
"Oil_Spill_Pts.shp". It has two fields: (1) id and (2) gallons. Gallons is the value
of gallons spilled, which I entered manually after placing points along Line 5
approximately where they match in the maps referenced in the above links


2) Crude Oil Pipelines data

Acquired shapefile from the US Energy Information Administration website link:
https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.php

Selected Crude Oil Pipelines shapefile for download
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

I then used a select by attribute query to select only pipelines owned by the company
Enbridge, and I used Export -> Save Selected Features As to export to a new shapefile
named "Enbridge_pipes", which I then displayed instead of all pipelines
Similarly, from Enbridge_pipes I selected Line 5 and used Export ->
Save Selected Features As to export to a new shapefile named "Line5pipeline"

I edited the line 5 line based on link to maps for the oil spills that showed more
precise line location versus more approximate lines I downloaded


3) National Forest polygons

From the USDA Forest Service website I downloaded national dataset of National Forest polygons,
with the file named "Administrative Forest Boundaries" from:
https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries

I downloaded this shapefile then imported it into QGIS


4) Line 5 spill scenarios (shapefile I created)

I created a new layer called Spill_Scenarios and digitized the area in Lake Michigan
and Lake Huron that would kind of be a worse case scenario where oil could reach
if a spill occurred in Mackinaw straights. My digitizing was an approximation of
the area covered by a greater than 0% chance in Figure 12 from this report:
https://graham.umich.edu/media/pubs/Mackinac-Line-5-Worst-Case-Spill-Scenarios.pdf


5) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


6) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/

After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


7) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile

Downloaded 1:50m scale lakes shapefile of Earth lakes from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-lakes-reservoirs/

After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove most of the lakes. I selected the lakes (below) to keep, then
inverted the selection and deleted all the other lakes.
Lakes to keep:
Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Great Salt Lake


After prep in QGIS, my layers from top to bottom for my map were:
1) Historical oil spills points (.csv I created)
2) Line5pipeline (shapefile)
3) Enbridge_pipes (shapefile)
4) National Forest Polygons (shapefile)
5) Line 5 spill scenarios (shapefile I created)
6) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
7) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile (shapefile)
8) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile (shapefile)

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in and edited the layers as described in the prior section

Given the focus of my map is Michigan and surrounding states, I wanted a projected coordinate
system with focus on MI, so I chose Lambert Conformal Conic NAD83/Michigan Central
(EPSG: 26989), so I switched to this projection using Project Properties.

For the Oil Spill points, I made it so size of point was based on the gallons of oil spilled.
Only spills over 1000 gallons had a circle size greater than 0. The size categories were:
1000-4200
4200-96,600
96,600-222,600
222,600-285,600
The color for these points was: R: 35, G: 35, B: 35

For Line5pipeline, I made the stroke width 0.8, and color was R:0, G:0, B:0

For Enbridge_pipes, I made the stroke width 0.3, and color was R:48, G:48, B:48

For National Forest polygons, color was R:51, G:100, B:44, opacity = 75%

For Spill_Scenarios polygon I used a hashed black / fill. Stroke width for fill
was 0.36. Stroke for line was 0.3. Color for all was R:45, G:45, B:45

For states 5m Cart Boundary, fill color was R:255, G:255, B:255, stroke color was
R:168, G:168, B:168, stroke width = 0.26

For 50m lakes layer, fill color was H:167, S:20, V:96, R:197, G:246, B:235,
stroke color was R:168, G:168, B:168, stroke width = 0.26

For 50m land layer, fill color was R:240, G:240, B:245, stroke color was
R:168, G:168, B:168, stroke width = 0.26



I then exported the map layers as a PDF using Project > Import/Export > Export Map to PDF
PDF export parameters:
Resolution: 250 dpi
Scale: 1:7,000,000
W bound: 4851143.9537
N bound: 662435.5608
E bound: 6406893.9553
S bound: -333985.2735
output tiff: 2188 x 1401 pixels




I then brought PDFs into new Adobe Illustrator file and copied them to a new art board
with 2188 x 1401 pixels dimensions.

Adjusted size of the land + lakes layer and point locations layer by 275% so that
scaled them to the art board.

Edited Line 5 so stroke width = 4, other pipelines stroke = 1.

I then adjusted coloring for layers. For oil spill points, I reduced them to 40%
opacity. National Forest Land was reduced to 25% opacity. Lakes were reduced
to 70% opacity.

I manually put labels on for oil spill amounts and then crafted and added text
to describe the map and a bit of Line 5 history.
