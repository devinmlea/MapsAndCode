Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my food/drink map for #30DayMapChallenge

I kind of just decided to run with this idea since some of my other
original thoughts were not working. Originally thought to do
whole state but figured partway through to just focus on UP.

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were seven data sources I acquired:
1) Pasty restaurant locations (Google, .csv I created)
2) Michigan 1:5m counties (shapefile)
3) 1:50m lakes polygons (shapefile)
4) 1:5m state boundaries (shapefile)
5) 1:50m land polygons (shapefile)
6) Pasty image (Wikimedia Commons)
7) Michigan counties population (.csv)


1) Pasty restaurant locations (.csv I created)
In Google search I typed "where can I get a pasty in michigan" and then on
Google Maps results panned and zoomed in/out all around the Upper Peninsula
to see all places that were returned in results. I recorded these on a .csv
file I set up in Microsoft Excel but then switched to Wordpad because I found
it easier to copy/paste data into Wordpad. For every place I found in my
Google Search I also used Google Geocoding API manual interface:
https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geocoder
to find latitude and longitude for each location, which was saved as part
of data in my .csv
* Initially I tried to use https://overpass-turbo.eu/ OpenStreetMap Data with
call below:
area[name="Michigan"];
nwr(41.5,-90.5,48.5,-81.5)[name~"^Pasty"];
out;
This didn't return almost any hits, so I decided to collect manually because not
enough data seemed available via OpenStreetMap

2) Michigan 1:5m counties (shapefile)
Obtained Michigan counties shapefile from US Census Bureau website
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
I selected Michigan counties using Select by Attribute:
"STATEFP" = 26
Then saved the selected polygons as a new shapefile

3) Natural Earth 50m lakes shapefile
Downloaded 1:50m scale lakes shapefile of Earth lakes from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-lakes-reservoirs/
After downloading the lakes and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS
and edited to remove most of the lakes. I selected the lakes (below) to keep, then
inverted the selection and deleted all the other lakes.
Lakes to keep:
Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Great Salt Lake

4) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

5) Natural Earth 50m land shapefile
Downloaded 1:50m scale land shapefile of Earth landmasses from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-land/
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

6) Pasty image (Wikimedia Commons)
Obtained from:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cornish_pasty_-_cut.jpeg

7) MI Counties Population Data (.csv)
Data from here:https://www.michigan-demographics.com/counties_by_population
The population data are from the 2021 Population Estimates Program and 2020 American Community Survey

Data Visualization
###########################################################

Loaded data layers into QGIS. For .csv pasty restaurant data, used lat
and long to plot locations as points

First changed projection to EPSG:26989 (NAD83 / Michigan Central)

Layers distributed in following order from top to bottom:
- Pasty restaurant points
- Michigan counties
- 1:50m lakes
- 1:5m state boundaries
- 1:50m land

I centered the Upper Peninsula in my viewing window and set scale to
1:2,700,000, then set symbology for layers as follows:

Michigan Counties:
Fill Color (hex:e9c591)
This color was sampled from crust of the pasty image
Stroke Color (hex:232323), 0.26 width

Lakes:
Fill Color (hex:a6cee3)
Stroke Color (hex:232323), 0.26 width

State boundaries
Fill Color (hex:dcdcdc)
Stroke Color (hex:232323), 0.2 width

1:50m Land
Fill Color (hex:dcdcdc)
Stroke Color (hex:232323), 0.2 width

I then using editing deleted counties in Lower Peninsula that were
within viewing window so I would only see upper peninsula counties

Then exported map as PDF at 1:2,700,000 and 200 dpi

Opened Adobe Illustrator and copied data from PDF to new .ai file

Loaded and copied Pasty image to map and scaled it appropriately,
then added text explanation and copied to cover points in each location
and labeled each location using text

I decided I also wanted to determine the ratio between number of
residents in each UP county and number of pasty serving places, so
I acquired population data and calculated the ratio between population
and number of pasty serving places:
Delta 35874/7 = 1:5,124
Baraga 8337/2 = 1:4,168
Marquette 66403/16 = 1:4,150
Dickinson 25373/7 = 1:3,624
Gobebic 14715/5 = 1:2,943
Menominee 22902/8 = 1:2,862
Schoolcraft 8031/3 = 1:2,677
Houghton 35890/16 = 1:2,243
Iron 11099/6 = 1:1,849
Alger 9098/5 = 1:1,819
Chippewa 37418/22 = 1:1,700
Luce 6286/4 = 1:1,571
Ontonogan 5802/6 = 1:967
Mackinac  10781/15 = 1:719
Keweenaw 2102/3 = 1:700

I then used this to assign colors for each county based on
the ratio, which I also added as text and matching colors
to the text for the map. Basically, Mackinac and Keweenaw
Counties kept the original color I used for the counties
in the PDF export (hex: e9c591), and then I scaled the colors
from this

full = 91% V value in QGIS

Delta 40% (80% opacity)
Baraga 45% (82% opacity)
Marquette 45% (82% opacity)
Dickinson 55% (85% opacity)
Gobebic 60% (85% opacity)
Menominee 65% (87% opacity)
Schoolcraft 67% (88% opacity)
Houghton 70% (90% opacity)
Iron 75% (92% opacity)
Alger 75% (92% opacity)
Chippewa 80% (94% opacity)
Luce 82% (95% opacity)
Ontonogan 86%
Mackinac & Keweenaw 91%
