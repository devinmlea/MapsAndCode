Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my space map for #30DayMapChallenge

I thought this would be both a fun conceptualization of space as well as
giving me the chance to make something fun showing off the place I live
and often walk or pass by many of these murals

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

Acquired 3 main data sources:

1) Michigan building footprints by Microsoft Maps (geoJSON layer)
2) Oakland county roads (shapefile)
3) Pictures of Berkley Murals


1) Michigan building footprints by Microsoft Maps (geoJSON layer)

The building footprints I used were from Microsoft's US Building Footprints,
which I acquired from this link:
https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints
Because this file is so big, as part of another project I had the buildings
broken up into multiple layers, which I used for this map.


2) Oakland county roads

This US Census Bureau layer I obtained from following link:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
I selected 2021 year, then for state "Michigan" and county "Oakland county"
Unzipped file and loaded in QGIS

3) Pictures of Berkley Murals
All pictures used for this map are my own that I took. Living in Berkley I knew
where generally to find many of the murals, but I also walked through a lot of
areas where I expected I might find some and found a few I didn't know existed
before this project.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the buildings footprints and roads
and zoomed in to area of Berkley.

Set roads color to white and buildings color to gray (R:120,B:120,G:120)

I then exported the map as a PDF using Project -> Import/Export ->
Export Map to PDF.

I then created a new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator. Using the rectangle tool
I covered the artboard with a black (0,0,0) rectangle. I then opened the
PDF layer containing roads and building footprints and copied them into
my .ai file.

I knew the murals were all generally on 11 mile, Coolidge Hwy, and 12 mile, but
if North was up this made placing a title difficult. I decided to rotate the
map data 90 degrees so that the west extent of my area of interest (bounded by
Greenfield Road) was up and that I could use this area for my title without
obscuring mural locations. I also knew that it was not likely going to be possible
to put the mural pictures on their actual locations, so I decided the best choice
was to fill the center of the map with the pictures that would be matched by 
numbers with their map locations ringing the edge of the map along the three main
roads with murals.

After rotating and scaling the map to the artboard, I increased the stroke size of
roads (10pt for the four main roads, 3 pt for others) and labeled the four main
roads (11 mile, 12 mile, Greenfield Rd, Coolidge Hwy).

I used the rectangle tool again to make a dark gray partially transparent rectangle
in the center of the map, and on top of this I placed my images and numbered each
one, then placing the matching number where it is approximately located on the map.

Lastly, added title, north arrow, and my info.
